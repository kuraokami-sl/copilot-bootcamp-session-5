## Project Context

- Full-stack TODO application with React frontend and Express backend
- Focus on iterative, feedback-driven development
- Current phase: Backend stabilization and frontend feature completion

## Documentation References

Link to existing documentation (helps AI navigate the project):

- [docs/project-overview.md](../docs/project-overview.md) - Architecture, tech stack, and structure
- [docs/testing-guidelines.md](../docs/testing-guidelines.md) - Test patterns and standards
- [docs/workflow-patterns.md](../docs/workflow-patterns.md) - Development workflow guidance

## Development Principles

- Test-Driven Development: Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Incremental Changes: Small, testable modifications
- Systematic Debugging: Use test failures as guides
- Validation Before Commit: All tests pass, no lint errors

## Testing Scope

This project uses unit tests and integration tests ONLY:

- Backend: Jest + Supertest for API testing
- Frontend: React Testing Library for component unit/integration tests
- Manual browser testing for full UI verification
- DO NOT suggest or implement e2e test frameworks (Playwright, Cypress, Selenium)
- DO NOT suggest browser automation tools
- Reason: Keep lab focused on unit/integration tests without e2e complexity

**Testing Approach by Context**:

- Backend API changes: Write Jest tests FIRST, then implement (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- Frontend component features: Write React Testing Library tests FIRST for component behavior, then implement (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR). Follow with manual browser testing for full UI flows.
- This is true TDD: Test first, then code to pass the test

## Workflow Patterns

Describe the development workflows to follow:

1. TDD Workflow: Write/fix tests → Run → Fail → Implement → Pass → Refactor
2. Code Quality Workflow: Run lint → Categorize issues → Fix systematically → Re-validate
3. Integration Workflow: Identify issue → Debug → Test → Fix → Verify end-to-end

## Agent Usage

Explain when to use each specialized agent:

- `tdd-developer`: Use for test-related work and Red-Green-Refactor cycles
- `code-reviewer`: Use for addressing lint errors and code quality improvements

## Memory System

- Persistent Memory: This file (.github/copilot-instructions.md) contains foundational principles and workflows
- Working Memory: .github/memory/ directory contains discoveries and patterns
- During active development, take notes in .github/memory/scratch/working-notes.md (not committed)
- At end of session, summarize key findings into .github/memory/session-notes.md (committed)
- Document recurring code patterns in .github/memory/patterns-discovered.md (committed)
- Reference these files when providing context-aware suggestions

## Workflow Utilities

Explain GitHub CLI commands for workflow automation (available to all modes):

- List open issues: `gh issue list --state open`
- Get issue details: `gh issue view <issue-number>`
- Get issue with comments: `gh issue view <issue-number> --comments`
- The main exercise issue will have `Exercise:` in the title
- Steps are posted as comments on the main issue
- Use these commands when `/execute-step` or `/validate-step` prompts are invoked

## Git Workflow

Explain conventional commit format and branch strategies:

- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, etc.
- Feature branches: `feature/<descriptive-name>`
- Always stage all changes before committing: `git add .`
- Push to the correct branch: `git push origin <branch-name>`
